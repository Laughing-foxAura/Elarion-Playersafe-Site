 <br><br>
“By fire, we rose.”
<br><br><br>House Dravakar is the oldest and most feared noble house in the <a data-href="Arken Dominion" href="kingdoms\arken-dominion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Arken Dominion</a>. Its name is synonymous with both the glory of conquest and the price of hubris. Descended from the original bloodline that led the hunt against the dragons, the Dravakars now rule from the Ember Throne, a blackstone dais embedded with molten crystal, perpetually surrounded by flowing lava.<br>They are the only house to bear the true curse of the dying red dragon whose breath melted the Dominion’s capital into its current volcanic state. Though the curse disfigured many and twisted the land, the Dravakars embraced it as divine judgment—and forged themselves anew.<br><br><br>
<br>Many members of House Dravakar exhibit draconic mutations: glowing ember-like veins, eyes that flicker like flame, or scorched, scale-like skin  
<br>They wear armor forged from heat-bound obsidian and dragonbone, often etched with infernal script or fire-glyphs  
<br>Their voices carry an unnatural weight, and it’s said the air shakes slightly around them when they are angry  
<br><br><br>
<br>The Ember Throne is always occupied by a Dravakar; they serve as the Dominion’s ultimate rulers, both politically and spiritually  
<br>They command not only armies but the Flamebound Court—an elite cadre of fire-mages, executioners, and priests who maintain the cursed flame at the heart of the capital  
<br>No law passes without their mark. No rebellion begins without first fearing their gaze  
<br><br><br>
<br>House Dravakar believes in burning away weakness—in themselves, in others, in the world  
<br>They view their curse as both a punishment and a blessing, proof of their unique destiny  
<br>Children of the house undergo ritual trials of flame at age 10. Those who survive are named. Those who fail are forgotten  
<br>The eldest Dravakars teach that the curse will only be lifted when the Dominion surpasses the dragons in all things—in magic, power, and legacy  
<br><br><br>Highlord Kavalh Dravakar, the Flame-Ordained King  <br>
<br>A brooding, iron-handed monarch with half his face encased in blackened crystal  
<br>Rumored to sleep atop molten stone, communing with something ancient that lives beneath the capital

 <br><br>
“The forge obeys the hand that dares.”
<br><br><br>House Ferrosyn is the industrial engine of the Arken Dominion—pioneers of arcane machinery, molten metallurgy, and volatile innovation. They possess no ancient bloodline magic, no divine favor—only relentless experimentation and ambition born in fire.<br>Where others seek mastery, Ferrosyn seeks momentum. Their workshops never sleep. Their prototypes often explode. But when one works, it changes the battlefield, the market, or the Dominion itself.<br><br><br>Tovar Ferrosyn<br>

<br>Features constant experimental trials, rune-bonding chambers, and alchemical exhaust vents.  
<br>Citizens of Cindermarch are issued sootmasks at birth.
<br><br><br>
<br>Failure is fuel. If it breaks, improve it.  
<br>Magic is not sacred—it’s machinery in waiting.  
<br>A slow forge cools to ash. Ferrosyn moves fast, even when the sparks burn.

“Stone remembers flame.”
<br><br><br>House Keldros is the silent cornerstone of the Arken Dominion — not born of fire or magic, but forged through generations of discipline, mastery, and design. They are builders of obsidian cities, architects of lava-fed aqueducts, and custodians of structural balance in a land shaped by eruption.<br>Their legacy is not flashy, but enduring.

<br>Houses the Guild of Earthbinding and a deep-locked chamber where failed blueprints are ritually sealed.
<br><br><br>
<br>Greatness is built — not inherited, not gifted.  
<br>Magic is a tool, not a master. It must be wielded with precision.

“The truth burns slow.”
<br><br><br>House Pyrenel walks between prophecy and power. They are flame-readers, emberspeakers, and veilwatchers of the Arken Dominion — those who peer into fire and shadow to unearth secrets and shape outcomes. <br>They command no battalions or forges, but revelation itself.

“Stand where even flame must break.”
<br><br><br>House Varnoss is the steel spine of the <a data-href="Arken Dominion" href="kingdoms\arken-dominion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Arken Dominion</a>. These are the Dominion’s warlords, tacticians, and builders of ash-bound citadels, commanding the fortresses that line the molten chasms and borderlands. Though fiercely loyal to the Ember Throne, Varnoss is the only house with the military power to challenge it—should they ever turn.<br>Where <a data-href="House Dravakar" href="houses\arken\house-dravakar.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">House Dravakar</a> rules and others serve, Varnoss endures.

<br>Varnoss nobles are towering and disciplined, often marked by ceremonial battle-scars and obsidian-trimmed armor inscribed with kill-counts and unit symbols  
<br>They speak in clipped, precise sentences—even in court—because command must never be misheard  
<br>Children of the house are raised alongside squires and soldiers, learning warcraft before diplomacy

<br>“Strength in silence, victory in resolve.”

<br>They believe the lava-choked land is sacred because it resists, and any wall that falls must be rebuilt stronger

 <br><br>A city of crumbled secrets, unstable skies, and gnomes chasing echoes from another world.<br><br><br>Cenwyn sits deep inland among craggy hills and half-submerged ruins—remnants of a civilization shattered by Selune’s fall. It is the closest major city to the scars of the collapse, and its landscape bears permanent arcane trauma:<br>
<br>Stones levitate and drift, anchored by forgotten runes  
<br>Clouds spiral endlessly above ruined towers  
<br>Flora glows, sings, or blooms in impossible configurations
<br>Above all, Cenwyn is a city of curious minds, working tirelessly to contain, understand, or repurpose the unstable legacy of Selune.<br><br><br>Gnomes make up the majority of the population, thriving in this world of peril and potential.<br>
<br>Every family maintains a Relic Registry, tracking the artifacts of Selune they've uncovered, lost, or… regretted  
<br>Practical attire includes arcane tool belts, reinforced vests, and radiant crystal accents  
<br>Conversation is rapid, technical, and only slows for metaphor or puzzles
<br>Other groups include:<br>
<br>Rock and deep gnomes, both claiming different historical ties to Cenwyn  
<br>Humans and half-elves, drawn to study the ruins or chase long-lost magic
<br><br><br>Cenwyn is led by the Vault Conclave, a meritocratic council of relic-reclaimers.<br>
<br>Power is earned through discovery, not bloodline  
<br>The current Prime Vaultkeeper is Irix Qindlehop, an eccentric gnome who wears an ancient adaptive mask believed older than the Pactlands themselves  
<br>Influence shifts often — a new breakthrough can change the city’s direction overnight
<br><br><br>
<br>Magic here is volatile — wild surges and ritual backlashes are common  
<br>Despite this, Cenwyn is a hub of magitech and arcane advancement, fueled by relic recovery  
<br>Echo Shards — levitating relic crystals — provide public lighting, wards, or communication links  
<br>Locals refer to Selune as “the dream that cracked open the world”, a phrase used in both reverence and caution
<br><br><br>Cenwyn is one of the most rift-active zones in the continent.<br>
<br>Riftstorms cause seasonal inversion, sky mirages, and soundless thunder  
<br>Dormant portals exist, but activating them often requires unknown conditions  
<br><br><br>
<br>Obelion’s leyline fluctuations are beginning to resonate with rift activity — some fear Selunian mechanisms could reawaken  
<br>A missing relic team returned after encountering warped reflections of themselves — survivors speak of mirrored selves and collapsing realities  
<br>Debate rages: some want to rebuild a gate to Selune’s center, others argue the island should remain untouched

 <br><br>A city of plenty, patience, and deeply rooted traditions.<br><br><br>Nestled in the southern lowlands of the Valewind Pactlands, Estrellan is a beacon of balance and bounty. Golden grain fields stretch beyond the horizon, interspersed with whitewashed stone walls and carefully enchanted irrigation ditches. Life moves slowly here—but deliberately.<br>Estrellan is not a place of innovation, but of wisdom tested by time. Though its halfling residents are often underestimated, their quiet magic and deep-rooted rituals keep half the Pactlands fed and steady.<br><br><br>Halflings are the heart of Estrellan, many tracing their lineage back dozens of generations on the same plot of land.<br>
<br>Homes are earth-rooted, built into rolling hillsides or field boundaries  
<br>Community life revolves around song-archives, seasonal markers, and oral histories  
<br>Though small in stature, halflings wield subtle agricultural magic refined over centuries
<br>Other groups include:<br>
<br>Hill dwarves and gnomes, focused on waterworks, tools, and mills  
<br>Dryads and minor nature spirits, bound in ancestral agreements  
<br>Wandering druids or rangers, offering seasonal aid and protection
<br><br><br>Estrellan is led by the Council of Seeds, composed of elders and farmers selected every seven years by quiet consensus.<br>
<br>Governance is guided by the Cycle Doctrine: “What has worked shall work, until it doesn’t.”  
<br>The current First Chair, Maela Hearthbud, is a blunt but beloved herbalist with an uncanny memory  
<br>Deliberation here is slow by design—rushed decisions are seen as dangerous, especially with magic
<br><br><br>Estrellan’s steady hand sustains the Pactlands through:<br>
<br>Grain, vegetables, and enchanted produce  
<br>Brewing herbs and dreamleaf teas, especially prized in Velmira and Mossmere  
<br>Heirloom seeds with mild enchantments—rot-resistance, frost warmth, or growth-predictive hums
<br>Though rarely flashy, Estrellan’s food supply is irreplaceable, granting it immense political weight without overt force.<br><br><br>
<br>Daily life is interwoven with music, meals, and storytelling—labor is never silent  
<br>Four major festivals mark the turning year:

<br>Blooming Fair (spring)
<br>Harvest Watch (autumn)
<br>Frost Silence (winter)
<br>Rain Rites (early summer)


<br>
“We don’t bend the world. We help it lean where it already wants to go.”
<br><br><br>
<br>Estrellan has refused to expand its farming zones, citing the soil’s need for rest—others call this selfish or outdated  
<br>Rumors of “whispers in the wheat” have spread: ᛈᛃᚹᚷ ᛏᚱᛞᛁᛃ voices ᚾᛒᛚᚦᚲ ᛁᛖ ᛉᛒᛈ fields ᚹᛟ ᚱᛠᛡᛇᛠᚦ ᛚᚢᛖᛇᛒᚢ ᚠᛁᚢᚠᛈᛡ ᛈᛒᚹᛒ ᚹᛋᛒᚺᚾᛇᚹᛝ ᚲᛗ recall ᚷᚢᛠᚹᛈ ᚷᛚᚺᛋᛚ ᚺᛠᛒᛗᛡᛋᚱ

Instead, it is a communal stronghold, shaped by the needs and styles of its diverse inhabitants — especially those of animalistic and primal lineages.<br>You'll find:<br>
<br>High roosts for aarakocra
<br>Burrows and heating tunnels engineered by kobolds
<br>Tree-shaded avenues where harengon merchants and lizardfolk guards mingle
<br>Open-air plazas for tabaxi dancers and shifter scouts
<br><br><br>
<br>Shifters – Versatile scouts, spies, and guards  
<br>Tabaxi – Traders, storytellers, performers, and messengers  
<br>Lizardfolk – Practical laborers, hydrological engineers, and stalwart militia  
<br>Kobolds – Tinkerers and civic planners; designed Myrhold’s tunnels and ventilation  
<br>Harengon – Ferry operators, agricultural leaders, and festival organizers  
<br>Aarakocra – Skyward sentinels and council couriers, with aeries along canyon cliffs
<br><br><br>
<br>The High Council convenes every 30 days in the Stone Nest, a massive open-air amphitheater  
<br>Council chairs rotate by consensus between enclaves and cities  
<br>The civil government is managed by a Warden Marshal, elected annually by council vote

<br><br><br>While not a commercial hub like <a data-href="Tarnath" href="houses\dravandor\tarnath.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Tarnath</a>, Myrhold thrives by:<br>
<br>Hosting diplomatic negotiations between distant groups  
<br>Maintaining elite defensive contracts and mercenary organizations  
<br>Operating sky-path courier networks and subterranean tunnel transport  
<br>Producing goods via kobold tinkerers and lizardfolk artisans
<br><br><br>Myrhold’s defense systems are legendary:<br>
<br>Multi-tiered walls, built with kobold ingenuity and shifter foresight  
<br>Roost towers used by aarakocra for dive support and long-range alerts  
<br>Hydraulic floodgates capable of redirecting canyon water during sieges  
<br>A diverse militia, where each racial community trains specialized units
<br>The city is called the Roosted Bastion because it doesn’t just resist attack — it actively watches from every height and shadow.<br><br><br>Despite its unity, Myrhold faces pressure:<br>
<br>Obelion’s presence continues to amplify the local leyline — some councilors fear it is reshaping the land itself

During high tide, waves crash through natural sea-arches beneath the city, earning it the name: “The Singing Cliffs.”<br>Tarnath is a smuggler’s haven, a privateer’s market, and a refuge for the unwanted — especially tieflings. Though it wears the mask of tradition and legitimacy, beneath the surface lie whispered deals, coded contracts, and veiled truths.<br><br><br>Tieflings make up more than half of Tarnath’s population. Many trace their roots to exiles who sought a new beginning far from judgment.<br>
<br>Though not evil, tieflings are viewed with fear and suspicion across most of the world  
<br>Tarnath offers a rare safe harbor for tiefling culture, though even here, old biases still linger  
<br>Cultural markers include brass-inlaid architecture, emberspun cloaks, and fire-dancer traditions
<br>Other notable populations:<br>
<br>Half-orcs – Shipwrights, brawlers, and harbor hands  
<br>Triton – Maintain and navigate deep-sea routes  
<br>Transient merchants – All races, though few settle long-term
<br><br><br>Tarnath is ruled by the Blackscale Accord, a loose council of ship captains, syndicate leaders, and trade barons.<br>
<br>Current Chair: Mariel Skahr, a red-skinned tiefling corsair with a golden eye and a silver tongue  
<br>Publicly supports the <a data-href="Myrhold" href="houses\dravandor\myrhold.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Myrhold</a> High Council, but often pursues independent trade agendas  
<br>Leadership is determined through influence, coin, and clever threat, not election or lineage
<br><br><br>Tarnath is the main port city of the Pactlands and manages:<br>
<br>Spices and rare herbs from <a data-href="Mossmere Basin" href="houses\valewind\mossmere-basin.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mossmere Basin</a>  
<br>Minerals smuggled across Pactland borders  
<br>Illicit and foreign magical items — often unsanctioned  
<br>Commissioned vessels, including the rare elemental-powered ships
<br>Despite its wealth, Tarnath is distrusted by cities like <a data-href="Estrellan" href="houses\dravandor\estrellan.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Estrellan</a> and <a data-href="Cenwyn" href="houses\dravandor\cenwyn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cenwyn</a> — especially for its rumored criminal ties and occult leanings.<br><br><br>
<br>Decorative horns, infernal rings, and ember embroidery are common fashion  
<br>Values freedom, cunning, and results over legacy or pretense  
<br>Night of the Sealed Flame: a solemn candlelit festival honoring ancestral memory  
<br>Local sayings favor wit: “A lie well-spoken is a coin well-earned.”
<br><br><br>
<br>Accused of harboring cultists from the <a data-href="Shattered Sight" href="major-powers\shattered-sight.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Shattered Sight</a>, though no evidence has surfaced  
<br>The docks glow faintly at night, and tides ripple without wind — possible rift activity offshore  
<br>House Delyssar scholars recently arrived under the pretense of trade study — but their true goals are unclear

 <br><br>Where illusion cloaks truth, and revolution is rehearsed like theater.<br><br><br>Velmira rests in the highlands west of <a data-href="Myrhold" href="houses\dravandor\myrhold.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Myrhold</a>, nestled among rolling hills of wildflowers, drifting mist, and ethereal twilight. At first glance, it feels more like a dream than a city — its towers twist impossibly, plazas shift with the seasons, and its fog-draped streets conceal both stages and secrets.<br>Once a quiet haven for eladrin and fey-touched wanderers, Velmira has evolved into a cradle of artistry, illusion, and political unrest.<br><br><br>Eladrin form the heart and soul of Velmira, their seasonal moods shaping the very architecture and rhythm of the city.<br>Each district resonates with a seasonal aspect:<br>
<br>Springlight — Passion, invention, youthful optimism  
<br>Summertide — Dueling academies, pride, and vibrant expression  
<br>Autumborne — Philosophy, melancholy, poetic subversion  
<br>Winterveil — Cold resolve, silent rebellion, and covert planning
<br>Other residents include:<br>
<br>Changelings – Welcomed for their fluid nature and kinship with illusion  
<br>Half-elves – Many raised as full citizens of Velmira  
<br>Humans and gnomes – Often drawn by the city’s bardic academies and arcane salons
<br><br><br>Velmira is a Pactlands member in name, but not always in heart.<br>
<br>Governed by the Council of Blooming Masks, whose members are selected every five years through public performance and acclaim, not votes  
<br>True power often lies in salons, underground stages, and revolutionary circles  
<br>Most influential figure: Seran Valquinn, eladrin of the Autumn Court — playwright, cultural icon, and ᛇᚱᛈᛝᚱᚱᛇᚲ ᛚᚦᛗᛋᛠᛟ ᛃᛖ ᚺᛡᚱ ᛃᚠᛁᚲᛒᛁᛗᛞ ᚦᚠᛁᚷᛃᛞᛇᛇᛁᛞᛠᛏᛋᛈ ᚹ ᛈᛇᚢᛋᛉᛒᛗ ᛗᚺᛞᚢᛚᛗᚷ ᚲᛠ ᛝᛝᛇᛈᛉᛋᚺᛖ ᚹᛝᚺ ᛟᚱᛒᛉᚠᛇᛖᛇᛃ
<br><br><br>
<br>Illusion magic is everywhere — from streetlamps and signage to clothing and architecture  
<br>Velmirans speak in double meanings and wear enchanted masks or accessories that shift with emotional state  
<br>Theater is sacred — every major play is a political act, and subversion is applauded more than patriotism  
<br>Some streets only appear at night, or only to those in particular moods or memories
<br><br><br>Velmira exports:<br>
<br>Enchantment and illusion services  
<br>Elite graduates from bardic and arcane academies  
<br>Cultural and theatrical works with magical or ideological weight
<br>Technically illegal activities quietly tolerated:<br>
<br>Illusion-based gambling  
<br>Glamour duels  
<br>Fey-pact ceremonies
<br><br><br>
<br>Radical youth factions demand either independence or resistance to <a data-href="Obelion" href="major-powers\obelion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Obelion</a>’s influence  
<br>A traveling troupe vanished last month; only their enchanted masks were recovered from Foglake  
<br>Illusory storms have begun sweeping the city unbidden — too complex for casual spellcasters, yet no mage claims credit

 <br>“We do not rule the tree. We ask. And sometimes, it answers.”<br><br><br>Greenthorn Canopy is a living enclave built into and upon the vast boughs of Yssaviel, a sentient, ancient tree believed to predate recorded history. Suspended above the forest floor, the settlement exists in delicate harmony with the canopy and the elemental leyline that pulses through its roots.<br>It is one of the few places in the world where nature speaks back — not just through druidic interpretation, but literally, when Yssaviel chooses to communicate.<br><br><br>Speaker Thalya<br>
A reclusive firbolg mystic, bonded to Yssaviel through ancient rite.<br>
<br>Serves as both emissary and protector of the tree.  
<br>Speaks rarely, but when she does, her words are treated as the voice of the forest.  
<br>Known to vanish for weeks into the tree’s upper boughs during times of disturbance.  
<br>Said to have been born beneath Yssaviel and raised by its will.
<br><br><br>
<br>Inhabitants live in woven homes of bark, vine, and leaf — shaped with permission, not construction.  
<br>No metal is mined or forged here; tools are made from bone, stone, and enchanted wood.  
<br>Important decisions are made through Listening Circles, where participants commune with Yssaviel via shared dreams or rootbinding rituals.  
<br>Outsiders are welcome, but only after completing a rite of intention under Thalya’s watch.
<br><br><br>The Greenthorn Canopy sits directly above a leyline convergence that hums with pure elemental essence. This energy is channeled through Yssaviel’s roots, branches, and the canopy itself.<br><br><br>Rootwatcher Emril<br>
A blind elf who walks barefoot among the roots, able to interpret tremors in the bark as language.<br>Callen Mossbloom<br>
A half-orc herbalist and musician who trades in rare spores and sings lullabies to Yssaviel’s seedlings.<br><br><br>
<br>Druids of the Outer Circles disagree with Thalya’s isolationist policies, wanting Greenthorn to play a more active role in Pactland defense.  
<br>Some whisper that Yssaviel is sleeping more often, and when it dreams, the air itself changes — ᛞᛞᚱᚦᛋᛚᛋᛁᚠ ᚾᛇᚨᛋᚢᛗᛇᛞᛇᚠᚨᚢ  
<br>A scorched ring recently appeared in the western boughs, repelling all regrowth. No cause has been found.

 <br>A wide, fertile lowland where the leyline pulses beneath tranquil fields and flowing waters.<br><br><br>Nestled in a broad, mist-shrouded depression in the eastern <a data-href="Valewind Pactlands" href="kingdoms\valewind-pactlands.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Valewind Pactlands</a>, Mossmere Basin is a haven of herbal craft, water-based magic, and elemental communion. The region is lush year-round, its waterways fed by underground aquifers that pulse with leyline resonance, giving rise to flora and fauna found nowhere else.<br>What appears at first glance to be an agrarian settlement is actually one of the most spiritually attuned enclaves in the Pactlands, where the boundaries between the Material Plane and the elemental forces of Water and Life grow thin.<br><br><br>
<br>Canals and terraces dominate the landscape, feeding shimmering rice paddies, medicinal herb beds, and strange floating lily platforms.  
<br>The air is thick with fragrance, from dew-heavy lavender to basil moss and pondblossoms.  
<br>Water elementals, called rillkin, wander freely — most the size of children, some the size of hills.  
<br>Certain trees and reeds hum or sing when touched by wind or rain, resonating with the leyline like living instruments.
<br><br><br>The basin is led by the Circle of the Bloomed Flow, a council of herbalists, spirit-tenders, and druids.<br>Mira Hollowroot<br>
Current speaker of the council. An herbalist-diplomat who has studied at both <a data-href="Greenthorn Canopy" href="houses\valewind\greenthorn-canopy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Greenthorn Canopy</a> and <a data-href="Obelion" href="major-powers\obelion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Obelion</a>.<br>
<br>Serves as the bridge between the practical and spiritual aspects of Mossmere.  
<br>Calm, deliberate, and known for carrying live moss on her robes.
<br><br><br>
<br>Herbcraft is more than alchemy — it is a sacred rite, blending plant lore, song, and elemental cooperation.  
<br>Apprentices learn the Three Infusions:  

<br>Sunbrew – tied to warmth and growth  
<br>Dewsteep – tied to clarity and healing  
<br>Rootfold – tied to memory and stillness  


<br>Spirit festivals are held during the Flood Moon, when the wetlands are at their peak and the veil thins.
<br><br><br>Mossmere provides:<br>
<br>The highest quality herbs and spiritual tonics in the region  
<br>Spiritual balancing services to enclaves with unstable magical zones  
<br>Peacekeeping rituals and mediating presence  
<br>A tradition of neutrality, avoiding direct confrontation but subtly shaping outcomes
<br><br><br>While peaceful, Mossmere is not without threat:<br>
<br><a data-href="Obelion" href="major-powers\obelion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Obelion</a>’s presence has strengthened the leyline, causing some water spirits to become erratic or territorial  
<br>Internal druidic sects debate whether to bind the leyline more tightly or let it flow freely  
<br>Suspected external herb thieves have weakened the balance in certain groves

 <br>A haunted marshland where the oldest pacts linger, whispered to by fog and root.<br><br><br>Sablefen lies in the southeastern marshes of the <a data-href="Valewind Pactlands" href="kingdoms\valewind-pactlands.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Valewind Pactlands</a>, a region of thick fog, whispering reeds, and water that never runs still. It is a place of pacts and promises, where warlocks enter agreements not with devils or fey alone, but with ancient spirits, primordial echoes, and slumbering forces long since abandoned by gods and druids alike.<br>The land is heavy with memory. Every vine and ripple speaks of oaths made, broken, or still binding.<br><br><br>
<br>Light rarely pierces the thick canopy; the air smells of rot, wet bark, and ghost-lilies.  
<br>Fenlanterns — wandering blue lights — guide, mislead, or test travelers.  
<br>The still water reflects more than the sky — sometimes showing secrets or potential futures.  
<br>Voices can carry farther than they should… or not at all.
<br><br><br>Sablefen’s people are mostly warlocks, but they don’t wear the title openly. Here, one doesn’t “cast” a spell — they invoke, entreat, or fulfill.<br>
<br>Locals are quiet, watchful, and tend to speak in layered metaphors.  
<br>They refer to their patrons as “the Bound,” “the Listeners,” or “the Deep Signed.”  
<br>There are no formal schools — patrons choose who they will whisper to.  
<br>Training comes in dreams, rituals, and near-drownings.
<br>Binder Zilma of the Still Veil<br>
A warlock who made her pact with the Root Without Shadow. She can silence a spirit with a glance and is said to keep three promises unfinished — one of which protects the swamp itself.<br><br><br>Sablefen warlocks forge pacts through swamp-bound rituals, dream-walks, and sacred drownings. <br>Common traditions:<br>
<br>The Listening Soak – Sitting submerged in sacred bogs until a pact whispers back  
<br>Swamp Naming – Individuals are renamed when their patron first speaks to them  
<br>The Dimming – A warlock ritually ends their pact, either by outgrowing it… or being consumed
<br><br><br>
<br>Others come to Sablefen when magic fails or spirits turn cruel.  
<br>Their services include curse unraveling, planar negotiations, and retrieving lost knowledge — all for a price.  
<br>The enclave maintains no alliances, but no one dares provoke them either.
<br><br><br>
<br>Since <a data-href="Obelion" href="major-powers\obelion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Obelion</a> began amplifying the leyline above the Pactlands, new voices have begun speaking to the people — some not native to this plane  
<br>A few warlocks are attempting to bind new types of patrons, creating rifts between tradition and experimentation  
<br>The <a data-href="Shattered Sight" href="major-powers\shattered-sight.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Shattered Sight</a> cult has attempted to recruit from Sablefen twice. They were repelled… but ᚠᚹᚨ ᛝᛚᛞ ᛇᚺᛚᛇᚢ ᛋᛗᛒᛡᚠ ᛝᛈᛏᛚ ᛇᚱᛁᚢᛗᚠᛞᚹᚷ

 <br>“The stone remembers.

It is a sacred place to earth-touched druids and elemental binders, revered as a living memory of the world’s deep rhythms.<br>Unlike surface settlements, Stonegrove is woven into the landscape. Halls are grown from crystal. Doors are carved into slow-moving shale. The very walls hum with magic — especially when unspoken truths stir below.<br><br><br>There is no singular leader. Stonegrove is guided by the Circle of Shards, a rotating council of druids, geode-seers, and elemental hosts.<br>
<br>The Circle interprets crystal harmonics to guide decisions, believing the land itself speaks through vibration.  
<br>During moments of crisis, an Anchor-Binder is chosen to embody the will of the stone and act as speaker and shield.
<br><br><br>
<br>Memory is sacred. Stones record — through resonance and pressure — all that passes above them.  
<br>Each child receives a Resonant Name, tied to the sound the stone sings at their birth.  
<br>Oral traditions are “sung” into crystals, which replay the knowledge to future listeners when touched.  
<br>Elemental spirits of earth and crystal are revered as ancestors, not just forces.
<br>Visitors are expected to walk barefoot when possible — to offer their full presence to the stone.<br><br><br>
<br>Geode-reading is used to divine the past, not the future. The present is considered unknowable until it echoes.  
<br>Harmonic Trials are rites where initiates must find resonance with a living crystal bloom — not all succeed.

 <br><br>The Arken Dominion is a theocratic empire fueled by divine zealotry and volcanic might. Centuries ago, it led the purge that nearly wiped dragons from the world. For this crime, it was cursed by a dying red dragon whose flame turned their capital into a volcano—one they now harness for power.<br>
<br>Type: Religious Empire / Theocracy  
<br>Ruler: Emperor Kavalh, Flame-Ordained  
<br>Capital: Varkhaz-Thul  
<br>Magic: Only divine and state-sanctioned arcane magic  
<br>Military: Zealot legions and firebound warpriests  
<br>Alignment: Lawful Neutral (with fanatic overtones)
<br><br><br>The Dominion believes its destiny is to shape the world through divine fire and purification. Faith and loyalty to the Flame Creed are absolute. Technology and craftsmanship are advanced, powered by lavaforges and sacred flame rituals.<br>
<br>Common Language: Drakhan (shared with older dwarven dialects)
<br>Religion: The Flame Creed (a fusion of divine law and elemental fire worship)
<br>View on Magic: Only ordained warpriests and flamebound mages may practice
<br><br><br>Each noble house commands a vital pillar of the Dominion’s volcanic empire—whether through industry, flame-wrought magic, or martial might. While most swear loyalty to the Ember Throne, the true depth of their ambition is often hidden beneath the ash.<br><br>

 <br><br>The Dravandor Confederacy is a union of five independent city-states that formed a defensive alliance against the growing power of <a data-href="Virelia" href="kingdoms\virelia.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Virelia</a>. Though united in name, each city maintains its own identity, laws, and leadership. Internal tensions and ideological differences prevent full cohesion, but the shared threat of invasion keeps them aligned.<br>
<br>Type: Confederacy of free cities
<br>Structure: Semi-independent city-states with a rotating High Council
<br>Capital (rotating): Currently Myrhold
<br>Military: Diverse and decentralized; relies on regional militias and contracted adventurers
<br>Magic: Lightly regulated; varies by city
<br>Alignment: True Neutral to Chaotic Good
<br><br><br><br>
<br>Known for its strategic location and strong walls
<br>Hosts the rotating High Council
<br><br>

<br><br>
<br>Home to bards, artists, and illusionists
<br>Politically rebellious, culturally vibrant
<br><br>
<br>Deep inland city surrounded by ruins

<br><br>
<br>Agricultural powerhouse
<br>Conservative in governance, slow to act militarily
<br><br><br>
<br>Each city is ruled by a local council or elected archon
<br>High Council meets twice per season; rotates by city
<br>Laws vary per city but Confederacy-wide rules protect member sovereignty and mutual defense
<br><br><br>
<br>Magic is freely practiced in most cities, though Cenwyn now places restrictions near rift zones
<br>The Confederacy has close ties with the <a data-href="Adventurer’s Guild" href="major-powers\adventurer’s-guild.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Adventurer’s Guild</a>

 <br><br>Myriath is a shining city of marble domes, golden spires, and holy silence—widely considered the spiritual heart of the continent. Though referred to as a “kingdom,” it is a single autonomous city-state led by the Church that venerates the martyr-saint Vivi. Myriath maintains neutrality in all wars, offering sanctuary, healing, and divine guidance to those in need.<br>
<br>Type: True Neutral Theocracy  
<br>Ruler: The Council of Halos (symbolically led by Saint Vivi)  
<br>Alignment: True Neutral (Public); subtle Good leanings  
<br>Military: No formal army, but elite paladins and clerics patrol the mountains  
<br>Protected by: The Perfect Barrier
<br><br><br>Saint Vivi cast the Perfect Barrier 100 years ago before dying, leaving behind a ward that detects alignment and repels all who harbor evil. It is located at the base of the northern mountain range separating the civilized world from the realm of monsters.<br><br><br>
<br>The Council of High Clerics interprets Vivi’s teachings and oversees doctrine.
<br>The Sanctum of Radiant Peace is the seat of divine power and home to the barrier's origin.
<br>Regional Priories answer to Myriath’s spiritual authority but govern their local churches.
<br><br><br>
<br>Central Faith: The Radiant Path (based on the teachings of Saint Vivi)
<br>Tenets:

<br>Do no evil, knowingly or otherwise
<br>Serve the light in word, action, and memory
<br>Defend the innocent, but do not seek war


<br>Healing is sacred and reserved for those of pure intent
<br>Alignment is considered part of the soul; those of evil alignment cannot enter Myriath at all
<br><br><br>
<br>No formal army
<br>Paladins, clerics, and divine wardens guard the city

 <br><br>The Valewind Pactlands are a loose federation of druidic enclaves, nature-bound towns, and leyline sanctuaries. Bound by ancient pacts, not crowns, the Pactlands serve as neutral stewards of balance and renewal. They hold no standing army, but their land is fiercely protected by awakened beasts, forest spirits, and gifted rangers.<br>
<br>Type: Druidic Federation / Council Rule  
<br>Governance: Council of Speakers (one per major enclave)  
<br>Capital: No formal capital; Speaker's Meeting held at various sacred groves  
<br>Military: None; defended by magical wards, beasts, and druids  
<br>Alignment: Neutral Good
<br><br><br>The Pactlanders live close to nature, often with semi-permanent homes that blend into trees, cliffs, or living hills. Different enclaves follow their own traditions but share a reverence for the balance between life and death, growth and decay.<br>
<br>Languages: Common, Sylvan  
<br>Religion: Nature spirits, ancestral roots, elemental forces  
<br>View on Magic:

<br>Druidic magic is sacred
<br>Arcane magic is accepted if tied to natural leyline currents
<br>Artificial magic (e.g., constructs, necromancy) is frowned upon


<br><br><br>The land itself pulses with magical power. Several leylines intersect in Valewind, feeding the forests and influencing druidic rites.<br>
<br>Obelion’s floating island currently resides above Valewind.
<br>Its presence strengthens the central leyline—an unexpected phenomenon.

 <br><br>The Adventurer’s Guild is a transnational organization that offers contracts, certifications, and logistical support to those rare individuals gifted with the ability to level up. The Guild maintains neutrality in all conflicts and does not serve any crown or kingdom.<br>Its main headquarters is not part of any nation—it exists as an independent town, fortified and self-sustaining, where adventurers train, rest, and report. Only those bearing a recognized Guild emblem may enter the central tower.<br>
<br>Type: Independent Free Town  
<br>Leadership: The Grandmaster of Quests and the Circle of Guildmasters  
<br>Alignment: True Neutral  
<br>Motto: “For coin, cause, or challenge—walk the path.”
<br><br><br>The Guild operates in tiers, both for adventurer ranking and organizational authority. Every regional guild reports to the central HQ.<br><br>(from lowest to highest):<br>
<br>Porcelain  
<br>Copper  
<br>Bronze  
<br>Iron  
<br>Silver  
<br>Gold  
<br>Platinum  
<br>Mithril  
<br>Orichalcum  
<br>Adamantite  
<br>
Note: Mithril and higher ranks can only be achieved through extraordinary deeds and a formal recommendation by a Guildmaster or higher.
<br><br><br>The HQ town—known as Steelmark—is built on neutral land between major kingdoms. It is fortified like a citadel, but functions more like a merchant-adventurer republic.<br>
<br>Includes:

<br>Training grounds  
<br>Contract halls  
<br>Arcane registry  
<br>Alchemical shops  
<br>Small arena for mock trials and public duels  
<br>Airship pad (restricted access)  


<br><br><br>
<br>The Guild does not take sides in wars.
<br>Adventurers who act in war are seen as mercenaries, not official agents.
<br>Guild contracts are public record. Every quest must be registered.
<br>Failure to report actions may result in rank loss or expulsion.
<br><br><br>
<br>Grandmaster Reign Evershade – Oversees the central HQ and final rank promotions
<br>Mistress Vallan of Maps – Coordinates geographic contracts and lost ruins
<br>Eldren Flintmark – In charge of the bounty ledger and monster classifications

 <br>
“Where the Eye gazes, truth breaks.”<br>
— Fragment from a salvaged Selunean hymn
<br><br><br>Once the heart of Selune, the Eye of the World was a towering arcane structure seated on the circular island at the center of the crescent-shaped Selune. Believed to predate even the Kingdom of Selune itself, the tower was more than a seat of power—it was a trial, a beacon, and a containment vessel for the darkness that stirred beneath the island.<br>The Eye collapsed centuries ago when the island of Selune fell into chaos and was lost to the world. Its fall ripped open the veil between realms, letting in monsters, corrupted magic, and artifacts from beyond the known world.<br><br><br>Only in the final years before the fall was the Eye’s true nature rediscovered:<br>
<br>
🔺 A Trial of Succession:<br>
The tower was not simply a royal symbol—it was a test. Deep within its halls lay a series of arcane and moral trials, meant to judge and prepare a candidate to become the Vessel, a ruler tasked with absorbing and containing the darkness below Selune.

<br>
🌀 An Arcane Beacon:<br>
The tower channeled leyline energy through Selune. Scholars believe it maintained magical equilibrium between the material plane and something outside it.

<br>
🔒 A Seal:<br>
The Throne of Sealing, located at the tower's summit, was both a crown and a cage. Each Vessel who sat upon it bound themselves to the darkness, delaying its escape through self-sacrifice and strength of will.

<br><br><br>The final Vessel, a once-noble king, was corrupted by the very force he was meant to contain.<br>
Rather than dying to protect Selune, he turned on his people, shattered the tower’s inner wards, and helped bring about the island’s destruction.<br>The collapse:<br>
<br>Tore open rifts between planes
<br>Released monsters and magic not seen in the world before
<br>Caused Selune’s total isolation, leaving it unreachable by magic or sea
<br><br><br>In the final years before Selune’s fall, the truth about the Trial of the Eye became known. One last group of adventurers, renowned across the continent, attempted to ascend the tower and seal the darkness anew:<br>
<br>Rune, a warforged mage whose very design echoed the lost machines of Balance  
<br>Valira, a tiefling warlock scorned by society, but gifted in weaving truths from the Void  
<br>Athena, a human paladin whose faith had once caused monsters to flee at her presence  
<br>And a fourth, never named in any surviving record—some say by choice, others by necessity
<br>They failed. Whether they fell during the trials, were betrayed by the throne, or simply could not reach the summit in time is unknown. But their attempt marks the last known act of resistance before the tower was consumed by darkness.<br><br><br><br>
<br>Founded by a mage who came into contact with the broken throne long after the collapse.  
<br>This survivor claimed the Eye whispered truths that no mind was meant to hold.  
<br>A rift-born monster confirmed the visions before its death, giving rise to a fanatic belief that the Eye was divine.
<br>
“We are not meant to seal the Eye. We are meant to be seen by it.”
<br><br><br>
<br>A few fragments of tower, etched with runes that reshape when not looked at, have appeared in the hands of collectors, heretics, and the Delyssar.  
<br>One cultist’s blade, said to be forged from throne-shard metal, has the ability to "remember" each person it kills—growing heavier with each soul.
<br><br><br>
<br>The throne at the tower’s peak still exists, broken but not powerless.
<br>Some say the Eye was never meant to contain evil, but to draw it in like a lure for something greater.
<br>Certain storm-wracked nights bring echoes of Selune’s final cry to distant shores.
<br>Obelion wants access to surviving throne fragments—but Myriath forbids it.

 <br><br>Obelion—known as the One True Tower—is the last unified mage tower in the world. Built on a floating island suspended by ancient magic, it is both sanctuary and laboratory for the most gifted arcanists. Obelion maintains neutrality in global conflicts, but its eyes are everywhere.<br>
<br>Type: Arcane Institution (Floating Island)  
<br>Leadership: The Circle of Five (rotating archmage council)  
<br>Goal: Advance magical knowledge and replicate the Perfect Barrier  
<br>Mobility: The island can move slowly over months  
<br>Alignment: Lawful Neutral
<br><br><br>
<br>The floating island is anchored magically to the skies
<br>Movement is slow and deliberate, requiring months to change regions
<br>Currently resides above the <a data-href="Valewind Pactlands" href="kingdoms\valewind-pactlands.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Valewind Pactlands</a>, where magic is tolerated and leylines are strong
<br>Island Features

<br>Skyward Hall – central tower and lecture spire  
<br>Leyforge – where leylines are bent into power sources  
<br>Vault of Mirrors – a library of reflection magic and prophecy  
<br>Astral Garden – a floating crystal dome for planar study  
<br>Windstep Docks – suspended platforms where airships or guests arrive

<br><br><br>Obelion radiates strong arcane energy that empowers spells cast nearby. The floating island’s position affects leylines in the region below.<br>Leyline Effects
The Tower’s presence is strengthening the central leyline of the Pactlands. Druids are divided:

<br>Some fear destabilization if Obelion leaves  
<br>Others warn that this concentration of magic might awaken forgotten powers

<br><br><br>
<br>Replicating the <a data-href="Perfect Barrier" href="Perfect Barrier" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Perfect Barrier</a> of Saint Vivi is a top priority
<br>Study of rift energy, planar bleed, and remnants of Selune is ongoing
<br>Accepts magically gifted individuals from all nations—status or origin does not matter
<br><br><br>Obelion avoids war and refuses military contracts, maintaining total neutrality.<br>

<br>Master Ghallor Tane – Planar studies and void defense
<br>Scribe-Lord Kael of Chains – Forbidden magics and sealcraft
<br>Mistress Aivenna of Glass – Illusions and diplomatic outreach


<br><br><br>
<br>A leyline surge below Obelion threatens a Pactland settlement—Obelion wants a team to investigate.
<br>A mage has gone missing after researching the nature of the Barrier—last seen near <a data-href="Cenwyn" href="houses\dravandor\cenwyn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cenwyn</a> in the Confederacy.
<br>A rogue faction within Obelion seeks to descend the island permanently—help or stop them?

 <br>A cult born from broken truths and divine madness.<br><br><br>The cult was formed by a mage who journeyed to the ruins of Selune long after its collapse — centuries after it had vanished from maps and memory. This mage, whose name has been lost or erased, reached the shattered summit of the <a data-href="Eye of the World" href="major-powers\eye-of-the-world.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Eye of the World</a> and touched the remains of the broken throne. What they saw changed them.<br>They returned not with riches or relics, but with visions, half-mad poetry, and unsettling truths. Many dismissed them. Some listened. A few followed.<br>Everything changed when a rift-born monster, already revered by a fringe group, spoke its final words to the mage:<br>
“The Eye remembers you.”
<br>It then died laughing.<br>This moment marked the cult’s divine confirmation — the mage had not gone mad. The Eye was still watching.<br><br><br>

<br>The cult is largely unknown or dismissed, but <a data-href="House Thorne" href="houses\virelia\house-thorne.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">House Thorne</a>’s Inquisitors are openly tracking its fragments.
<br>Certain leyline flares and magical anomalies appear to align with cult activity — perhaps not by accident.
<br>Rumors say the cult is trying to reach Selune again, either physically or through planar magic, to return to the Eye’s root.
<br>Some fear they aim to create a new Eye elsewhere — one built not to contain, but to reveal.

 <br><br>The Red Howl was a prototype lava-powered mobile siege engine, designed to traverse molten terrain and launch magma-laced payloads at enemy fortifications.<br>Tovar Ferrosyn envisioned it as a revolutionary war machine—a symbol of Dominion superiority, capable of overwhelming monsters and rival kingdoms alike.<br><br><br>
<br>During its first full-scale demonstration, the Red Howl overheated catastrophically.
<br>Its internal core collapsed under thermal imbalance, triggering a violent venting of molten payloads.
<br>Two test engineers died instantly. Several others suffered severe burns.
<br>The blast damaged the outer city walls near the proving ground.
<br>Tovar barely survived—he still bears burn scars
<br><br><br>
<br>The Ember Throne intervened, terminating the Red Howl Initiative for "reckless deployment of uncontrolled innovation."
<br>Tovar was barred from initiating new siegecraft projects without Tribunal oversight.
<br>Though he remains the official head of House Ferrosyn, his political influence was weakened, especially among conservative houses like <a data-href="House Keldros" href="houses\arken\house-keldros.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">House Keldros</a>.
<br><br><br>
<br>Among Ferrosyn loyalists, the Red Howl is remembered as a tragedy of ambition—a vision smothered by fear.
<br>Among Dominion officials, it stands as a dire warning: power without control invites destruction.
<br>Some whisper the core may have reacted to something buried beneath the proving grounds—a tremor not of heat, but of will.

 <br><br>
“She gave her breath to the wind, her warmth to the sun, her will to the mountain—and her heart to the staff.”
<br><br><br>
<br>The staff is roughly six feet tall, but hovers half an inch above the ground, never fully touching it.  
<br>Its core is white ashwood, but it has been infused with radiant crystal, causing it to shimmer faintly with light that changes hue with alignment proximity.  
<br>Around the head of the staff spiral three golden rings, which move slowly and silently in orbit—each one etched with unreadable celestial script.  
<br>A faint chime rings from the staff when evil draws near, barely audible over the hum of the barrier.
<br><br><br>
<br>The staff was crafted not by hands, but by Saint Vivi herself, through an act of divine transmutation at the moment she invoked the barrier.  
<br>It is said the wood came from the First Tree of the mountain pass, and the light from a fallen star.  
<br>When Vivi cast the spell that formed the barrier, she poured her soul into the staff, causing her body to collapse and the artifact to root itself into the sanctum floor.

<br>Magic is rare. Only the Gifted can level up or cast spells.
<br>Healing magic is incredibly uncommon outside of the Church, elves, and adventurers.
<br>Potions only work for the Gifted.
<br><br>
<br>Magic items (wands, weapons, tools, etc.) can be used by anyone, even those without the Gift.
<br>This makes enchanted tools and relics incredibly valuable, especially to nobles, military forces, and wealthy tradesfolk. 
<br>Most magic tools are crafted with specific intent—many require training, activation rituals, or command words passed down through bloodlines or guilds.
<br>Powerful artifacts still require attunement by a Gifted soul.

“The world isn’t breaking. It’s remembering.”<br>
— Unknown bard, one night before vanishing near the Shoreline
<br><br><br>In recent years, strange phenomena have begun to surface across the land—glimmering distortions, patches of withered earth, places where time moves oddly. Some call them rifts. Others whisper of cracks in the world.<br>No one knows their true origin.<br>
<br>Scholars speculate they may be remnants of ancient magic.
<br>Some blame the fall of Selune, the lost island that once held the Eye of the World.
<br>Others claim the world is simply unraveling—slowly, and with purpose.
<br><br><br>
<br>Rifts appear in places of old power: forgotten ruins, ancient battlefields, leyline nexuses, or cursed groves.
<br>They are often harmless to observe, though deeply unsettling:  

<br>Colors shift,  
<br>Sound warps,  
<br>Gravity misbehaves.


<br>Magic acts unpredictably near them.<br>
Spells might flare, fizzle, or echo back twisted versions of themselves.
<br>Most rifts attract strange creatures. Others do nothing—for years.
<br>Tales persist of voices heard through rifts—familiar, dead, or never known.
<br><br><br>
<br>The Church:

<br>Cautious and divided. Some clergy call rifts divine trials; others fear corruption.


<br>The Adventurer’s Guild:

<br>Monitors and classifies rift zones.
<br>Bounties exist for rift investigation, recovery, or neutralization.


<br>The Magic Tower of Obelion:

<br>Publicly silent.
<br>Rumored to secretly observe, catalog, and experiment with rifts.


<br>Common Folk:

<br>Avoid rifts at all costs.
<br>Build shrines, wards, or stone circles nearby—just in case.

A rural city where sudden auroras and eerie rainfall are becoming common.<br>
Locals report strange dreams, missing livestock, and lights in the woods.<br>Obsidian Shoreline<br>
An abandoned port town where a rift shimmers offshore.<br>
Fishermen claim something watches from the sea floor.<br>The Withered Hollow<br>
A once-lush grove now completely dead.<br>
No birds sing, and tools rust overnight when left in the clearing.<br><br><br>
<br>Passing through a rift may change a person—body or soul.
<br>Artifacts found near rifts sometimes exhibit sentience or warped magic.
<br>Some bards sing of a time before the rifts, when the world was whole.<br>
